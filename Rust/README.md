# Rust README

## Structure

All files are located inside the rust/src folder. Inside it you can find a folder with the name of the topic covered by that part and, inside that folder, a mod.rs file with the code in it.

Come chapters are not located inside rust/src, and instead found in the root directory Rust. Those chapters are Chapter 12-An I/O project, Chapter 14.3-Cargo Workspaces.

## Considerations

To create a new rust project, you must have Cargo package installed and call the command ``` cargo new _projectName_ ``` inside the folder where you want to have the project.
