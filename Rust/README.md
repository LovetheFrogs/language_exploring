# Rust README

## Structure

All files are located inside the src folder. Inside it you can find a folder with the name of the topic covered by that part and, inside that folder, a mod.rs file with the code in it.

## Considerations

To create a new rust project, you must have Cargo package installed and call the command ``` cargo new _projectName_ ``` inside the folder where you want to have the project.

## References

All info is extracted from the [official Rust programming language docu](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
